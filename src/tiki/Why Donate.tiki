HamWAN will always offer free communication facilities to any amateur radio operator.

However, running this kind of network is not without cost.  The major costs are equipment and site rental fees.  While a great deal of effort goes into minimizing both, it is not possible to optimize them to $0.  To ensure the survival of the network, HamWAN must collect donations to cover these costs.

Please do help in growing the network and keeping it alive by becoming a donor!

HamWAN is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and publishes its financial details regularly.  We strive to keep a cash balance large enough to ensure survival, but any excess income will go into growing the network.  Your donation WILL make a difference in the world.  It won't just sit idly in a bank account.

Donations are tax-deductible.
