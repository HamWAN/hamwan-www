An experimental path across the Cascades has been identified:
# Baldi (deployed)
# [http://goo.gl/maps/5I4tU|Stampede Pass] or [http://goo.gl/maps/swM9I|Raven Roost]
# Naneum or Mission Ridge
# Mt. Spokane or Mica Peak
HamWAN has no presence at the last three sites. The link between Naneum/Mission and Spokane/Mica is very long and will require big dishes.

!!!Baldi - Naneum
It looks like Baldi-Naneum is possible in a single shot.
