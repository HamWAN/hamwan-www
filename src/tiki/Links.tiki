!!!General Notes on Links
Integrate with / make use of Radio Mobile or Radio Mobile Web, or the Linux Splat! application.  Present a map of links, their margins, their physical obsticles, their expected and recorded operating speeds.  Work with Core Routing to see where RF Links make the most sense.

Possibly keep track of Client Node link paths, but this seems like a lot of work.

Decent [http://www.afar.net/rf-link-budget-calculator/|online RF link calculator] for quick and dirty work.
