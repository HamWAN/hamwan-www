A lot has changed since HamWAN first launched. We used to recommend the [http://www.titanwirelessonline.com/Poynting-5-8GHz-31dBi-Grid-p/at-30gr-58.htm|Poynting 5.9 GHz 30 dBi grid] and [http://www.balticnetworks.com/routerboard-metal-5shpn.html|Mikrotik RouterBOARD Metal 5SHPn wifi radio] to everyone. Now, many HamWAN sites are capable of MIMO -- meaning you'll get the best performance out of a similar MIMO client modem -- and there is a lot more compatible hardware on the market than there was before. Here is a comparison of a few options.

!!Considerations when choosing hardware
* Compatibility with HamWAN -- HamWAN sectors run Mikrotik nv2 TDMA mode in 5 and 10 MHz channels on 5.9 GHz. At the time of this writing, this requires a Mikrotik 802.11a/n modem (their 802.11ac modems cannot do 5 or 10 MHz channels) that is not frequency locked to Part 15.
* Predicted signal strength in your area vs antenna gain -- areas with strong signal have more options for smaller antennas
* Are you served by a MIMO site? If so, you'll get the best speeds out of MIMO hardware
* Potential for icing -- when icing is expected, stick to solid antennas and radomes. Grid antennas attract ice.
* Load rating of your support structure
* Price

{REMARKSBOX(type="warning" title="Warning")}
Avoid Mikrotik's 802.11ac modems. These are incapable of tuning the 5 and 10 MHz channels used by HamWAN and are therefore incompatible.
