Measuring ...
Detected measurement resolution of 0.574162679426 degrees.
Finding peak magnitude and angle ...
Normalizing magnitude by adding 29.3dB ...
-3dB beamwidth is 54.6581250429 degrees.
Centering on beamwidth by rotating readings -184.27218765 degrees ...
-120 degree gain = -23.3365195328dB, +120 degree gain = -25.7927081041dB.
