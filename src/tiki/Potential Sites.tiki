!Tools To Find Future Sites
Seek out and evaluate new sites for network nodes.  Take into account coverage mapping, costs involved, special restrictions, sustainability, ham population density, etc.

Useful links:

[http://lookup.logbook.am/ham-creeper|Ham Creeper]
[http://www.interceptradio.com/files/US/WA/radiomap.gif|Puget Sound repeater sites]

Use these two together to identify hams which are high up enough to be useful to the project.  Perhaps they'd be willing to host nodes for free?
