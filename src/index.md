A modern, multi-megabit, IP-based, digital network for amateur radio use!
=========================================================================

HamWAN is a non-profit organization (501c3) developing best practices for high speed amateur radio data networks. HamWAN also runs the Puget Sound Data Ring, which is a real-world network implementation of the proposed designs.

So far, HamWAN networks have been used for things like low-latency repeater linking, real-time video feeds from distant locations, serving APRS I-gates, providing redundant internet access to emergency operations centers, and more. Any licensed radio amateur in the service area can connect their shack directly to the network with just a small investment in equipment and no reoccurring cost. Since many traditional uses for Internet at home are not compatible with [Part 97 rules](/Internet and Part 97.html), this won't replace your home Internet connection. However, it works and acts just like one.

State of the Puget Sound Data Ring
==================================

HamWAN cells have been deployed to six sites. Each site is interconnected with 5.9 GHz modems and fully routed with OSPF. HamWAN provides routing to all existing AMPRNet systems. Examine the map below to determine if you're within the current HamWAN coverage area!

***INSERT MAP HERE***

Red "coverage areas" indicate a signal level of -70 dBm or better when using the 30 dBi recommended client antenna. A signal level of -70 dBm or stronger will support full speed, about 10 Mbps in areas with clear line of sight and no interference. Other areas with line of sight may have intermittent coverage or decreased speeds.

Blue lines indicate current connections to the HamWAN network. Line width indicates bandwidth.

Other Regions
=============

HamWAN is not just in Western Washington! There are a handful of networks around the United States implementing the HamWAN standard. Learn more about them at [Certification](/Certification.html).
